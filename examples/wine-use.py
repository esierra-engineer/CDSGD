# Read the CSV
data_path = "./data/wine.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# The dataset includes features related to wine properties and a target
# 'quality' for each sample
# 'good' and 'color' might be additional labels or features, depending on
# your analysis requirements

# For clustering, we typically don't use the label, but since 'good'
# and 'color' might be useful for some analyses, we'll keep them separate here.
X_custom = data.drop(columns=['quality', 'good', 'color'])  # Features matrix
y_custom1 = data['quality']  # Target variable 'quality'
y_custom2 = data['good']  # Binary indicator of wine being 'good'
wine_color = data['color']  # Wine color

# Instantiate DSClustering
# Form 1 - Default instantiation with just the feature matrix
ds1 = DSClustering(X_custom)
# Form 2 - Instantiation with a parameter to consider the most voted features
ds2 = DSClustering(X_custom, most_voted=True)
# Form 3 - Instantiation with a numeric parameter
ds3 = DSClustering(X_custom, 3)

# Apply the method to generate categorical rules
ds1.generate_categorical_rules()  # Generate rules for the first instance
ds2.generate_categorical_rules()  # Generate rules for the second instance
ds3.generate_categorical_rules()  # Generate rules for the third instance

# Apply the predict method (internally finalizes the classification model)
ds1.predict()  # Predict labels using the first set of rules
ds2.predict()  # Predict labels using the second set of rules
ds3.predict()  # Predict labels using the third set of rules

# Apply the method to print the most important rules
ds1.print_most_important_rules()  # Print rules from the first model
ds2.print_most_important_rules()  # Print rules from the second model
ds3.print_most_important_rules()  # Print rules from the third model

# Apply the method to print metrics
# is needed to encode y_custom to be use in this method
ds1.metrics()  # Print metrics for the first model
ds2.metrics()  # Print metrics for the second model
ds3.metrics()  # Print metrics for the third model
